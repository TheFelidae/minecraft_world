# `minecraft_world` crate for Rust

### HEAVY WIP

This crate is currently in heavy development and is not yet ready for use. Please check back later - Or, if you're feeling brave, feel free to contribute!

---

This crate provides a simple API to abstract and handle Minecraft worlds or Luanti (formerly known as Minetest) worlds, allowing you to read and write blocks, metadata, and other world data - All from Rust!

This crate hopefully would allow you to write custom abstraction layers, for if you want custom world data - Perhaps from a different game entirely - To work with your program.
